name: StudyGroup - Request for Proposal (RFP)
about: This is a template for requesting proposals from the community on a topic of
  your interest. Use this template to express what you'd like to learn or discuss
  about.

### Type: [Any|Talk|Demo|...] -- (use `Any` if you don't have a preference)

### Level: [Beginner|Intermediate|...] -- choose only one. Be specific about the entry criteria.

### Request:

Mention your request with great detail. Be specific about any problems that you'd like a possible proposal to throw light on.

### References:

Please provide a list of references to what you've already read, watched, or learnt from. This not only provides context to a potential proposer, but also allows the community to provide you with more existing reference material that may _probably_ satisfy your need.
