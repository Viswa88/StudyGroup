# Rules & Guidelines

This page lists guidelines specific to the StudyGroup. Every participant in the StudyGroup must adhere to these Guidelines at all times, in addition to the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct). If you are unfamiliar with the Code of Conduct (CoC), we suggest you read that first before reading this page.

## Rules

#### Rule 1 : Respect the conductor protocol

Each StudyGroup session will be conducted by one individual who'll preside over all aspects of the session, and will be the arbitrator for any concerns raised. The conductor is tasked with ensuring that the session stays on pace and finish in a timely manner, with sufficient time for Q&A. If a session goes off-pace, the conductor has the right to intervene and bring proceedings back on track. Example: This may include scheduling certain Q&A to be taken up after the talk, or offline etc.

A single StudyGroup session may also include multiple topics presented by multiple individuals. The conductor has the right to hint in advance, or intervene if a single topic goes beyond its stipulated time; such that other talk(s) get their fair share of time. Measures may include continuing the presentation in a separate session on a different date, and moving all of Q&A offline if need be.

In the absence of a single conductor for a session (due to any unforseen emergencies), the presenter of the topic will assume the role of the conductor for the duration of their topic and will be required to handover the charge to subsequent presenters. The session would assume a co-operative environment and presenters are free to request a nomination for conductor from the audience if they feel the need.

If you are a member of the audience, you are required to ensure that your actions don't adversely affect the how the session is conducted.

#### Rule 2 : Respect the Pass of Control

The session will involve individuals who'll assume the role of speaker and present their talk in their stipulated duration. They may also share their desktop in this process. Each speaker has the right to announce the protocol of `pass-of-control`. This would typically involve letting the audience know whether the speaker can be interrupted (to highlight specific points or ask questions). If such an announcement is not made, any audience member has the right to interrupt and clarify this protocol for everyone's benefit. The speaker may then pass control to other speakers who are next in line.

Each member of the session is expected to cooperate in ensuring that there is only one individual who is in control a a time (speaking, sharing desktop etc.) and any protocol for accepting Q&A (as announced during the session) is followed.

#### Rule 3 : Silence

All members are expected to place their microphones on `mute` unless it's their turn to speak. If a microphone of a listener is not on mute, then the other members have the right to request that member to mute their microphone. A request to `mute` must be obeyed in the interest of ensuring that any stray noise from members' surroundings do not affect the session; regardless of whether the member chooses to not speak at that point in time.

If the session platform allows for other members (or the conductor) to mute the microphone of other participants, that option can be exercised by the conductor or speaker to `mute` the microphone of the audience member.

Each member of the session is expected to respect the `silence` expected from them, when they have not been handed control.

If a member is unable to exercise control of their microphone for any reason (technical or otherwise), they should either attempt to join through another device where they may have this control, or they must drop-off the session in the interest of respecting `silence`.

#### Rule 4 : Language & Behaviour

All members of a session are expected to strictly adhere to the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct) at all times.

Language(s) for communication for sessions is pre-decided. All communication during the session is expected to take place in the chosen language(s), such that every member can comprehend, and participate in the discussion or Q&A. This also extends to any general talk between members, while waiting for other members to join the session or for the session to begin. The StudyGroup sessions are open to all individuals around the world. Any communication that's understood only by a subset of the audience would be treated as offensive (regardless of what the words actually mean in that language).

#### Rule 5 : Intellectual Property

DO NOT present content that's proprietary. The StudyGroups will only cater to content that's already open-source. You must provide links to the open-source content in your proposal. You must only present or work on the content that you have proposed for; during the session. DO NOT discuss how any of the open-source content gets used in your organization, provide stats, facts, learning based on usage etc.; that might be considered Intellectual Property not belonging to you.

If you plan to propose on any such content, PLEASE VERIFY AND CONFIRM that you are not in breach of any Intellectual Property agreements you might have signed, unless you have clearance in the form of specific WRITTEN consent from your organization's LEGAL team for the EXACT content that you choose to present. If you are in doubt, then you MUST NOT propose. So, we suggest that you check this FIRST, before you even begin with your proposal.

Rules governing IP and its breach are the SOLE RESPONSIBILITY of the participant(s) who are privy to the Intellectual Property. Nobody else shall be held responsible.


## Guidelines

#### Guideline 1 : Prepare your content well

If you are the speaker for any topic during a session, please prepare the content you wish to present before-hand. Sessions are of limited time, and you may need to prioritize on your content to meet the stipulated time. After a brief introduction to your topic, you should present content that's most beneficial to the audience first. Provide sufficient links and resources either before (in your proposal) or after your talk to allow your audience to explore your content further. Well thoughtout content ensures effective use of the stipulated time and also gives a good take-away to the audience.

#### Guideline 2 : Anticipate Q&A

StudyGroups are meant to be more interative. You should provision time within your talk to receive questions from the audience. Q&A also has a stipulated time. You may not be able to answer all questions within the stipulated time; and in such cases you can announce that you'll follow up offline (and you should follow up offline later :) ). It is OK to follow up on questions that you don't have an immediate answer for. It is OK to follow up on questions where you either anticipate a long answer, or an answer that doesn't address to the wider audience.

Do not forget to provide links and email ID to allow your audience to follow up.

#### Guideline 3 : Separate facts & opinions. Seek permission when necessary.

If you are speaking about code which you didn't author, then either refrain from providing opinions or seek permissions from the respective authors about the specific aspects you wish to study or present, and what aspects you wish to cover & highlight. Separate fact from opinion. Chances are; there is more to it than what you know. Understand that participating members may have lesser knowledge than you on the topic you present, and your opinion should not colour what they may be lead to believe.

#### Guideline 4 : Clean your desktop

If you are sharing your screen, ensure that you are not exposing anything that you don't require your audience to know about. Be watchful of other applications that may be open, browser sessions, desktop backgrounds etc. The Code of Conduct applies here as well. Be specifically vigilant of any content that falls into `Intellectual Property` that you absolutely MUST NOT share.
