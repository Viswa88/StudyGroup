# The GolangIndia StudyGroup

A StudyGroup is a web-conference session where Gophers (members of the Go community) can discuss, learn and present content. The aim of the web-based session is to allow pan-geographic participation, while also allowing for more cohesive discussions around the presented content.

With the aim of wider participation from members in India, the StudyGroup's schedule specifically caters to timeslots chosen on [IST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Standard_Time). However, all sessions of the StudyGroup are open to participation by anyone worldwide.

The language for communication will be English.

## Code of Conduct

All participants MUST adhere to the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).

Additionally, the GolangIndia StudyGroup requires participants to adhere to [StudyGroup Rules & Guidelines](RULES_AND_GUIDELINES.md).

## Schedule

The default schedule for the StudyGroup is **1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month at 21:00 IST**

If there is any deviation for an upcoming session from what's mentioned above, that info will be prominently indicated in the StudyGroup Session details at the top of this page.

## Proposals

The [Proposals](PROPOSALS.md) page has details on the formats in which you can propose a study session and how you should go about submitting one.

## Request for Proposals

If you are interested in learning about something in Golang, you can also submit a Request for Proposal (RFP). This helps identify areas where the community as a whole would like to learn about specific topics. This makes it easy for other individuals who have expertise in the topic to submit a proposal that might address this need.

The [Proposals](PROPOSALS.md) page also has information on how to submit RFPs.

## Questions, Feedback & Suggestions

If you'd like to volunteer or engage with existing volunteers who run StudyGroup-India on any aspect that generally concerns the StudyGroup, please consider submitting an [issue](https://github.com/golangindia/StudyGroup/issues/new/choose) using the template `Questions, Feedback & Suggestions`. You can find an official list of maintainers in the [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS) file, in case you wish to tag them in your communication. Please ensure that all you communication in this regard stays within the StudyGroup issue.
