# The GolangIndia StudyGroup

A StudyGroup is a web-conference session where Gophers (members of the Go community) can discuss, learn and present content. The aim of the web-based session is to allow pan-geographic participation, while also allowing for more cohesive discussions around the presented content.

With the aim of wider participation from members in India, the StudyGroup's schedule specifically caters to timeslots chosen on [IST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Standard_Time). However, all sessions of the StudyGroup are open to participation by anyone worldwide.

The language for communication will be English.

## Code of Conduct

All participants MUST adhere to the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct). The GolangIndia StudyGroup requires participants to additionally adhere to [StudyGroup Code of Conduct & Guidelines](STUDYGROUP_COC.md).
