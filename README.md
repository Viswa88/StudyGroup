# The GolangIndia StudyGroup

A StudyGroup is a web-conference session where Gophers (members of the Go community) can discuss, learn and present content. The aim of the web-based session is to allow pan-geographic participation, while also allowing for more cohesive discussions around the presented content.

With the aim of wider participation from members in India, the StudyGroup's schedule specifically caters to timeslots chosen on [IST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Standard_Time). However, all sessions of the StudyGroup are open to participation by anyone worldwide.

The language for communication will be English.

## Code of Conduct

All participants MUST adhere to the [Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).

Additionally, the GolangIndia StudyGroup requires participants to adhere to [StudyGroup Rules & Guidelines](RULES_AND_GUIDELINES.md).

## Schedule

The default schedule for the StudyGroup is **1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month at 21:00 IST**

If there is any deviation for an upcoming session from what's mentioned above, that info will be prominently indicated in the StudyGroup Session details at the top of this page.

## Proposals

The [Proposals](PROPOSALS.md) page has details on the formats in which you can propose a study session and how you should go about submitting one.
